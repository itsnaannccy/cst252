		<h1 class="main-title">Lab 13: Debugging</h1>

		<p>The purpose of the this lab, is to use our debugging knowledge to fix old assignments</p>

		<h2>Challenges:</h2>
		<p> There weren't many challenges durning this lab. Before turning previous labs I use
			  inspect console to check for any errors. However it didn't hurt to check every old JavaScript Labs
				again.
		</p>

		<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p> The output will appear below.</p>

			<h2>DEBUGGING</h2>

			<div class= "debug-img">
				<p>There was the the previous lab that i wanted to fix. It didn't have
				problems and it was doing what it was suppose to. But the code that I wrote was written
				different than how it was asked to do. However Wes clarfied by going over the lab, it
			  helped me understand better. I rewrote the javascript code by using wes's code since it
			  looked more efficient while fixing any bugs along the way. </p>
