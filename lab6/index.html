		<p>	The idea of this lab is to get familiar and experiment with Javascript
			arrays and objects.</p>

		<h2>Challenges:</h2>
		<p>One of the issues we faced was that the javascript wouldn't display on the
			 webpage due to small errors with commas and semicolons in the wrong place or
			 mising brackets. But we were able to fix them using the inspect tool on the
			 browser and the lecture slides for reference.
