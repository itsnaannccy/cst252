		<p>	Hello my name is Nancy Escobedo, I am a Communication Design Major with
		   	a concentration in Web Design. If I'm not in school or doing homework, I'm either inside;
			on my phone watching movies, reading, painting, or hanging out with my family. I also
			like to be outdoors hiking and walking on the beach in the Ford Ord Dunes state park.

			Hello my Name is Joanna Rubio, I am a Communication Design Major with a concentration
			in Visual Design. Currently in addition to school I am working two part time jobs in order to
			save up to study abroad for a year. During my free time I really enjoy playing video games,
			drawing, working out, and reading. Currently what takes up most of my free time is studying
			Japanese and Korean. I am trying to self teach with the help of some of my friends in order
			to travel more.
