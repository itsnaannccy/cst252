		<h1>Lab 4: Psuedocoding and Problem-Solving </h1>
		<p>	The idea of this lab is to get into the habit of psuedocoding</p>

		<h2>Challenges:</h2>
		<p> We didn't face too many challenges in regards to writing out instructions
			for the tasks below and turning them into pseudocode. There were tags in the
		  lab instructions, we weren't sure where to put them. We will wait
		  to know more about them and their purpose.</p>

		<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>Displayed in our webpage is the result of lab 4: </p>

<!-- Add your lists to your index.html -->
		<p> Pseudocode of an everyday task: Performing CPR</p>
		<ol>

				<li> Check if there is a qualified professional around</li>
				<li> Lay person on their back and open airways</li>
				<li> Make sure if they are breathing</li>
				<li> If person is not breathing proceed to begin CPR</li>
				<li> Start with 30 chest compressions</li>
				<ul>
						<li> Use 2 hands for adults</li>
						<li> 1 hand for children</li>
						<li> 2 fingers for infants</li>
						<li> Let chest rise in between each compression</li>
				</ul>
				<li> Then do two rescue breaths</li>
				<li> Repeat process until a Medical Professional arrives on scene</li>

		</ol>
		<br>
		<p> Pseudocode of a computer task: Creating a Hangman Game</p>
		<ol>
				<li>Come up with a word at random </li>
				<li>Display the length of the word to the user</li>
				<li>Correct_guesses is less than the length of the word</li>
				<li>Tell the user to guess a letter </li>
				<li>If the user guesses a correct letter, then user earns a point
					for correct_guesses</li>
				<li>If the user guesses an incorrect letter, then the user earns a point
					for incorrect_guesss and draw the next part of hangman. </li>
				<li>If the users incorrect_guesses are greater than 8, then the user has
					lost the game</li>
				<li>If the users correct_guesses are equal to the length of the word,
					then the user has won the game </li>
		</ol>
